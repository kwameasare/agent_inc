# Agentic Engineering System

A dynamic, phased multi-agent AI system that functions as an elite autonomous engineering team spanning software, hardware, product, and safety departments. The system implements **phased execution** with user approval workflows, optimizing for scalability, collaboration, traceability, and controlled delivery.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: Docker, Docker Compose, OpenAI API key
2. **Setup**: `echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env`
3. **Deploy**: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
4. **Access**: Open http://localhost:8081 for Mission Control UI
5. **Test**: Create a task and watch the phased execution in real-time

## Architecture

The system implements a **phased multi-agent architecture** with these core principles:

1. **Agents as a Commodity**: There is only one type of "worker" agent service. Its specialization (persona) is defined at runtime by the instruction prompt it receives.

2. **Phased Execution**: Tasks are broken down into distinct phases by a Lead Agent, with each phase containing a maximum of 10 domain experts who execute their work in parallel without further delegation.

3. **User-Controlled Progression**: After each phase completes, the user is presented with the results and can decide whether to proceed to the next phase or stop the execution.

This creates a **controlled, phased approach** where complex projects are systematically broken down into manageable phases with clear deliverables and approval gates.

## Components

### 1. Generic Agent (Python)
- **File**: `agents/generic_agent/agent.py`
- **Role**: Universal worker that can be anything you tell it to be
- **Technology**: Python + gRPC + LiteLLM (supports OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Key Feature**: Makes execute/delegate decisions autonomously using LLM reasoning

### 2. Orchestrator (Go)
- **File**: `orchestrator/main.go`
- **Role**: 
  - Lead Agent Coordinator (manages phased execution)
  - Domain Expert Manager (spawns and coordinates up to 10 experts per phase)
  - Phase Controller (handles phase completion and user approval)
  - Docker Manager (controls agent container lifecycle)
- **Technology**: Go + Docker SDK + gRPC + HTTP API + PostgreSQL

### 3. Mission Control UI (React/TypeScript)
- **Files**: `ui/src/*`
- **Role**: 
  - Professional three-panel Mission Control interface
  - Real-time task and phase monitoring with WebSocket updates
  - Phase completion visualization with expert tracking
  - User approval workflow interface
  - Modern responsive design with Tailwind CSS v4
- **Technology**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4

### 4. PostgreSQL Database
- **Files**: `orchestrator/database/db.go`
- **Role**: 
  - Persistent storage for tasks and phase results
  - JSONB storage for complex phase data
  - ACID compliance and structured querying
  - Production-ready scalability
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL 15 with JSONB support

### 5. Task Tree Manager
- **File**: `orchestrator/tasktree/manager.go`
- **Role**: Manages the hierarchical task structure with thread-safe operations

### 6. Docker Manager
- **File**: `orchestrator/docker/manager.go`
- **Role**: Spawns and manages agent containers dynamically

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker & Docker Compose**: Must be installed and running
   - **macOS**: Download Docker Desktop from https://docker.com
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose-v2` (Ubuntu/Debian)
   - **Windows**: Download Docker Desktop from https://docker.com
   
2. **OpenAI API Key**: Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   
3. **For Development** (optional):
   - **Go**: Version 1.21 or later (download from https://golang.org/dl/)
   - **Node.js**: Version 18+ for UI development
   - **Python**: Version 3.10+ for agent development

## üöÄ Installation & Quick Start

### Method 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to run the complete system with PostgreSQL database.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd agent_inc
   ```

2. **Create environment file**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your OpenAI API key
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

3. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   # Start all services (PostgreSQL, Orchestrator, Generic Agent)
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Access Mission Control**:
   - Open your browser to **http://localhost:8081**
   - Submit tasks and monitor phased execution
   - Approve or reject phase progressions

5. **Verify system health**:
   ```bash
   # Check all services are running
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps
   
   # Test API endpoint
   curl http://localhost:8081/health
   
   # Should return: {"status":"healthy","tasks":N,"timestamp":"..."}
   ```

6. **Stop the system**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
   ```

### Method 2: Development Setup

For development and debugging, you can run components individually.

1. **Set your OpenAI API key**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Start PostgreSQL database**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres
   ```

3. **Build the generic agent image**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build generic_agent
   ```

4. **Run the orchestrator**:
   ```bash
   cd orchestrator
   export DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5434/agent_inc?sslmode=disable"
   go run .
   ```

5. **Run the UI (optional, for development)**:
   ```bash
   cd ui
   npm install
   npm run dev
   # Access at http://localhost:5173
   ```

## How It Works

### 1. Initial Task Submission
Submit a high-level task through the web UI or directly to the orchestrator API.

### 2. Lead Agent Planning
A Lead Agent (Project Manager persona) analyzes the task and creates a phased execution plan with:
- **Phase breakdown**: Logical phases (e.g., "Requirements and Planning", "Design and Architecture")
- **Domain experts**: Up to 10 specialists per phase with specific personas and tasks
- **No sub-delegation**: Experts in Phase 1 complete their work directly without further delegation

### 3. Phase Execution
- All domain experts in the current phase execute their tasks in parallel
- Each expert focuses on their specific domain expertise
- Real-time progress monitoring through the web UI

### 4. Phase Completion and Approval
- When all experts in a phase complete their work, the phase is marked as complete
- User is presented with all expert results and the next phase plan
- User can choose to:
  - **Approve**: Proceed to the next phase
  - **Reject**: Stop execution and review results

### 5. Iterative Progression
- Approved phases trigger the next phase execution
- Process continues until all phases complete or user stops
- Final deliverable integrates all phase results

## Example Workflow

```
Initial Task: "Create a user authentication system"
    ‚Üì

```

### Using Mission Control

1. **Submit Task**: Use the "New Mission" button to create a complex engineering task
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time updates as the Lead Agent creates phases
3. **Review Phases**: Each phase shows expert assignments and progress
4. **Approve/Reject**: When a phase completes, review results and decide to continue
5. **View Results**: Expert outputs are displayed with syntax highlighting and formatting
6. **Activity Log**: Track all system events and user decisions in the activity panel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Docker daemon not running"**
   - Ensure Docker Desktop is running
   - Check Docker socket permissions

2. **"OPENAI_API_KEY not set"**
   - Create `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`
   - Or export the environment variable: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`

3. **"Port already in use"**
   - Stop existing containers: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down`
   - Check for conflicting services on ports 8081, 5434

4. **"Mission Control UI not loading"**
   - Verify orchestrator is running: `curl http://localhost:8081/health`
   - Check orchestrator logs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs orchestrator`
   - Ensure port 8081 is accessible

5. **"Database connection failed"**
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs postgres`
   - Check database health: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec postgres pg_isready -U postgres`
   - Verify connection: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec postgres psql -U postgres -d agent_inc -c "SELECT version();"`

6. **"Phase not progressing"**
   - Check that all experts in the phase have completed
   - Review expert logs for any failures
   - Verify user approval is not required

7. **"Expert containers not spawning"**
   - Verify Docker daemon is running
   - Check generic agent image exists: `docker images | grep generic_agent`
   - Review container logs for startup issues
   - Ensure OpenAI API key is valid

8. **"WebSocket connection failed"**
   - Check browser console for WebSocket errors
   - Verify orchestrator WebSocket endpoint: `ws://localhost:8081/ws`
   - Ensure no firewall blocking WebSocket connections

### Development Issues

9. **"Build failed"**
   - Ensure Go 1.21+ is installed: `go version`
   - Check for missing dependencies: `go mod tidy`
   - Verify Docker Compose file syntax

10. **"UI development server won't start"**
    - Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
    - Install dependencies: `cd ui && npm install`
    - Check for port conflicts on 5173

### System Health Checks

```bash
# Check all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps

# Test API connectivity
curl http://localhost:8081/health

# Test database connectivity
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec postgres pg_isready -U postgres

# View system logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs --tail 50
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Parallel Phase Execution**: All experts in a phase run concurrently
- **Resource Management**: Containers cleaned up immediately after expert completion
- **Model Selection**: Balance between capability and cost/speed per expert
- **UI Responsiveness**: Real-time updates via WebSocket without overwhelming the interface
- **Phase Optimization**: Logical phase boundaries reduce unnecessary work
- **Database Performance**: PostgreSQL with JSONB indexing for fast queries

## Security Notes

- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control. Use `.env` files or environment variables
