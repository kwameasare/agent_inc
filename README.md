# Agentic Engineering System

A dynamic, phased multi-agent AI system that functions as an elite autonomous engineering team spanning software, hardware, product, and safety departments. The system implements **phased execution** with user approval workflows, optimizing for scalability, collaboration, traceability, and controlled delivery.

## Architecture

The system implements a **phased multi-agent architecture** with these core principles:

1. **Agents as a Commodity**: There is only one type of "worker" agent service. Its specialization (persona) is defined at runtime by the instruction prompt it receives.

2. **Phased Execution**: Tasks are broken down into distinct phases by a Lead Agent, with each phase containing a maximum of 10 domain experts who execute their work in parallel without further delegation.

3. **User-Controlled Progression**: After each phase completes, the user is presented with the results and can decide whether to proceed to the next phase or stop the execution.

This creates a **controlled, phased approach** where complex projects are systematically broken down into manageable phases with clear deliverables and approval gates.

## Components

### 1. Generic Agent (Python)
- **File**: `agents/generic_agent/agent.py`
- **Role**: Universal worker that can be anything you tell it to be
- **Technology**: Python + gRPC + LiteLLM (supports OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Key Feature**: Makes execute/delegate decisions autonomously using LLM reasoning

### 2. Orchestrator (Go)
- **File**: `orchestrator/main.go`
- **Role**: 
  - Lead Agent Coordinator (manages phased execution)
  - Domain Expert Manager (spawns and coordinates up to 10 experts per phase)
  - Phase Controller (handles phase completion and user approval)
  - Docker Manager (controls agent container lifecycle)
- **Technology**: Go + Docker SDK + gRPC + HTTP API for UI

### 3. Web UI (React/Vite)
- **Files**: `ui/src/*`
- **Role**: 
  - Real-time task and phase monitoring
  - Phase completion visualization
  - User approval workflow interface
  - Expert status and progress tracking
- **Technology**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS

### 4. Task Tree Manager
- **File**: `orchestrator/tasktree/manager.go`
- **Role**: Manages the hierarchical task structure with thread-safe operations

### 5. Docker Manager
- **File**: `orchestrator/docker/manager.go`
- **Role**: Spawns and manages agent containers dynamically

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker**: Must be installed and running
   - **macOS**: Download Docker Desktop from https://docker.com
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose` (Ubuntu/Debian)
   - **Windows**: Download Docker Desktop from https://docker.com
   
2. **Go**: Version 1.21 or later
   - Download from https://golang.org/dl/
   
3. **Python**: Version 3.10 or later (usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux)
   
4. **OpenAI API Key**: Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   
5. **protoc**: Protocol buffer compiler
   - **macOS**: `brew install protobuf`
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler`
   - **Windows**: Download from https://protobuf.dev/downloads/

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/agent_inc
   ```

2. **Set your OpenAI API key**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Build the system**:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

4. **Run the system**:
   ```bash
   # Start the orchestrator
   cd orchestrator
   go run . &
   
   # Start the web UI (in a new terminal)
   cd ../ui
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the web interface**:
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Submit tasks and monitor phased execution
   - Approve or reject phase progressions

## How It Works

### 1. Initial Task Submission
Submit a high-level task through the web UI or directly to the orchestrator API.

### 2. Lead Agent Planning
A Lead Agent (Project Manager persona) analyzes the task and creates a phased execution plan with:
- **Phase breakdown**: Logical phases (e.g., "Requirements and Planning", "Design and Architecture")
- **Domain experts**: Up to 10 specialists per phase with specific personas and tasks
- **No sub-delegation**: Experts in Phase 1 complete their work directly without further delegation

### 3. Phase Execution
- All domain experts in the current phase execute their tasks in parallel
- Each expert focuses on their specific domain expertise
- Real-time progress monitoring through the web UI

### 4. Phase Completion and Approval
- When all experts in a phase complete their work, the phase is marked as complete
- User is presented with all expert results and the next phase plan
- User can choose to:
  - **Approve**: Proceed to the next phase
  - **Reject**: Stop execution and review results

### 5. Iterative Progression
- Approved phases trigger the next phase execution
- Process continues until all phases complete or user stops
- Final deliverable integrates all phase results

## Example Workflow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Docker daemon not running"**
   - Ensure Docker Desktop is running
   - Check Docker socket permissions

2. **"protoc command not found"**
   - Install Protocol Buffers: `brew install protobuf`

3. **"OPENAI_API_KEY not set"**
   - Export the environment variable before running

4. **"Port already in use"**
   - System automatically handles port allocation
   - If issues persist, restart Docker

5. **"Web UI not loading"**
   - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed
   - Check if port 5173 is available
   - Run `npm install` in the ui directory

6. **"Phase not progressing"**
   - Check that all experts in the phase have completed
   - Review expert logs for any failures
   - Verify user approval is not required

7. **"Expert containers not spawning"**
   - Verify Docker daemon is running
   - Check Docker image exists: `agentic-engineering-system_generic_agent`
   - Review container logs for startup issues

## Performance Considerations

- **Parallel Phase Execution**: All experts in a phase run concurrently
- **Resource Management**: Containers cleaned up immediately after expert completion
- **Model Selection**: Balance between capability and cost/speed per expert
- **UI Responsiveness**: Real-time updates without overwhelming the interface
- **Phase Optimization**: Logical phase boundaries reduce unnecessary work

## Security Notes

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Container isolation provides security boundaries
- gRPC communication is local-only by default
- Consider using secrets management for production

## Future Enhancements

- **Persistent Phase Storage**: Database backend for phase history
- **Advanced UI Features**: Gantt charts, phase analytics, expert performance metrics
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Deploy across cloud providers
- **Custom Expert Types**: Specialized agent types beyond generic personas
- **Integration Hooks**: Webhooks and API integrations for external tools
- **Phase Templates**: Pre-defined phase patterns for common project types
- **Collaborative Features**: Multi-user approval workflows
